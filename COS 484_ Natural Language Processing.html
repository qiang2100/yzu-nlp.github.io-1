  <p class="subheader">What is this course about?</p>
  Recent advances have ushered in exciting developments in natural language processing (NLP), resulting in systems that can translate text, answer questions and even hold spoken conversations with us. This course will introduce students to the basics of NLP, covering standard frameworks for dealing with natural language as well as algorithms and techniques to solve various NLP problems, including recent deep learning approaches. Topics covered include language modeling, representation learning, text classification, sequence tagging, syntactic parsing, machine translation, question answering and others.

  <p class="subheader">Assignments</p>
  <div class="section">
    All assignments are due at  <b><font color="red">9:30am</font></b> before the Tuesday lecture. There are 96 free late hours (~4 days) in total over all assignments. Once you have used up all your free late hours, late submissions incur a penalty of 10% for each day, up to a maximum of 3 days beyond which submissions will not be accepted. The only exception to this rule is if you have a note from your Dean of Studies. In this case, you must notify the instructors via email. For students with a dean‚Äôs note, the weight of their missed/penalized assignment will be added to the midterm and your midterm score will be scaled accordingly (for homeworks 0, 1 and 2) (e.g. if you are penalized 2 points overall, your midterm will be worth 27 and your score will be multiplied by 27/25). Missing homework 3 and 4 after the midterm can only be compensated by arranging an oral exam on the pertinent material.
  </div>

  <div class="section"><b>Writeups:</b>
    Homeworks should be written up clearly and succinctly; you may lose points if your answers
    are unclear or unnecessarily complicated.
    Using LaTeX is recommended (here's a <a href="https://princeton-nlp.github.io/cos484/assignments/template.tex">template</a>), but not a requirement. If you've never used LaTeX before, refer to this introductory guide on <a href="http://bit.ly/WorkingWithLaTeX">Working with LaTeX</a> to get started. Hand-written assignments must be scanned and uploaded as a pdf.
  </div>

  <div class="section"><b>Programming:</b>
    For each assignment, we provide a Google Colab file with the programming questions included. You‚Äôll need to make a copy of this file, fill in necessary parts, run results, and <a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/114CQ70qk8E--90qM8kxpTeegSATmDLIp7z_GVqJAGrk/edit?usp=sharing">upload the code and results as a PDF file</a>. If you've never used Google Colab before, refer to this introductory guide on <a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1LlnXoOblXwW3YX-0yG_5seTXJsb3kRdMMRYqs8Qqum4/edit?usp=sharing">Working with Google Colab</a> to get started.
  </div>

  <div class="section"><b>Collaboration policy and honor code:</b>
    You are free to form study groups and discuss homeworks and projects.
    However, you must write up homeworks and code from scratch independently, and you must acknowledge in your submission all the students you discussed with.
    The following are considered to be honor code violations (in addition to the Princeton honor code):
    <ul>
      <li>Looking at the writeup or code of another student.</li>
      <li>Showing your writeup or code to another student.</li>
      <li>Discussing homework problems in such detail that your solution (writeup or code) is almost identical to another student's answer.</li>
      <li>Uploading your writeup or code to a public repository (e.g. github, bitbucket, pastebin) so that it can be accessed by other students.</li>
    </ul>
    When debugging code together, you are only allowed to look at the input-output behavior
    of each other's programs (so you should write good test cases!).
    It is important to remember that even if you didn't copy but just gave
    another student your solution, you are still violating the honor code, so please be careful.
    If you feel like you made a mistake (it can happen, especially under time
    pressure!), please reach out to Karthik;
    the consequences will be much less severe than if we approach you.

  <p class="subheader">Final Project</p>
  <div class="section">
    <a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/e/2PACX-1vSvYEgiXYVzhlRDW1djIwbzShff-8vcPCHzONKdtTatya-hLDrpN382tEM3NdHJqW8NLFGCFFsCz-TZ/pub">[Project guidelines are available here]</a>
  <br><br>
  The final project offers you the chance to apply your newly acquired skills towards an in-depth NLP application. Students are required to complete the final project in teams of <b>3</b> students.
  <br>
  <br>
  There are <b>two</b> options  for the final project: (a) reproducing an ACL/NAACL/EMNLP 2020 or 2021 paper (encouraged); (b) complete a research project (for this option, you need to discuss your proposal and get prior approval from the instructor). All the final projects will be completed in teams of 3 students (Find your teammates early!).
  </div>

  <div class="section"><b>Deliverables</b>: The final project is worth 35% of your course grade. The deliverables include: </div>
  <ul>
      <li> <b>Proposal</b> (0%): You need to turn in a one-page proposal on Mar 29. The proposal should outline what you propose to do and a rough plan for how you will pursue the project. We will then provide feedback and guidance on the direction to maximize the project‚Äôs chance
of succeeding.  <i> The proposal is not graded.</i> </li>
      <li> <b>Project presentation</b> (10%): At the end of the semester, we will schedule project presentations for all the projects in the class.</li>
      <li> <b>Final paper</b> (25%): You need to complete a final report in the style of a conference (e.g. ACL) submission. It should begin with an abstract and introduction, clearly describe the proposed idea or exploration, present technical details, give results, compare to baselines, provide analysis and discussion of the
results, and cite any sources you used. </li>
  </ul>
  <!-- <div class="section"><b>Project ideas</b>: Come to talk to us during our office hours!</div> -->
  <div class="section"><b>Policy and honor code:</b>
    <ul>
      <li> The final projects are required to implement in Python. You can use any deep learning framework such as PyTorch and Tensorflow. </li>
      <li> You are free to discuss ideas and implementation details with other teams. However, under no circumstances may you look at another team's code,
or incorporate their code into your project. </li>
      <li> Do not share your code publicly (e.g. in a public GitHub repo) until after the class has finished.</li>
    </ul>
  </div>



  <p class="subheader">Submission</p>

  <div class="section"><b>Electronic Submission:</b>

    Assignments and project proposal/paper are to be submitted as pdf files through Gradescope.
    If you need to sign up for a Gradescope account, please use your @princeton.edu email address.
    You can submit as many times as you'd like until the deadline: we will only grade the last submission.
    <b>Submit early to make sure your submission uploads/runs properly on the Gradescope servers.</b>
    If anything goes wrong, please ask a question on Ed or contact a TA.
    Do not email us your submission.
    <b>Partial work is better than not submitting any work.</b> For more detailed information on submitting your assignment solutions, see this guide on <a href="http://bit.ly/COS_NLP_Submission">assignment submission logistics</a>.
    <p>
    For assignments with a programming component, we may automatically
    sanity check your code with some basic test cases, but we will grade
    your code on additional test cases.
    <b>Important</b>: just because you pass the basic test cases, you are by no
    means guaranteed to get full credit on the other, hidden test cases, so you should
    test the program more thoroughly yourself!
    </p>

  </div>


  <div class="section"><b>Regrades</b>: If you believe that the course
    staff made an objective error in grading, then you may submit a
    regrade request. Remember that even if the grading seems harsh to
    you, the same rubric was used for everyone for fairness, so this
    is not sufficient justification for a regrade.

    It is also helpful to cross-check your answer against the released solutions.
    If you still choose to submit a regrade request, click the corresponding
    question on Gradescope, then click the "Request Regrade" button at the
    bottom.
    Any requests submitted over email or in person will be ignored.  Regrade requests for a
particular assignment are due one week after the
grades are returned. Note that we may regrade your entire submission,
so depending on your submission you may actually lose more points
than you gain.

  <a name="faq"><span class="header">FAQ</span></a>
  <ul>
    <!-- <li>
      <b>Q: Are 584 students required to attend 584 precepts?</b> <br>A: Yes. Missing a session or two is all right given the remote environment, but participation is part of your grade. If you need to miss precept on a regular basis, then we recommend switching into 484 instead.
    </li><br>
    <li>
      <b>Q: Can 484 and 584 students work together on the final project?</b> <br> A: It's not encouraged since 484 and 584 have different expectations and group sizes. If you really want to do so, then you must write to the instructors and get permission.
    </li><br>
    <li>
     <b>Q: Can I attend 484 or 584 lectures (without grade or credit)?</b> <br>
     A: COS 584 is not open to students who are not enrolled, unfortunately. You can however attend COS 484 - the lectures and assignments will be shared with 584. You can find the Zoom link for the lectures on our Canvas site. If you are a Princeton student and cannot access Canvas, write to us (cos484-584-staff@lists.cs.princeton.edu) and we can try adding you manually. If you are not a Princeton student, you can participate in the Community Auditing Program (CAP) for COS484.
    </li><br> -->
    <li>
    <b>Q: Can we do the project in a team of 2? </b> <br>
    A: We strongly encourage you to have 3 members on your team. If you really want work in a team of 2, please write to us (cos-484-2022@googlegroups.com) with a justification and a rough plan of the project. We want to make sure the scope and workload of the project is reasonable and note that we will grade projects regardless of team sizes.
    </li><br>
    <li>
    <b>Q: I'm not enrolled (or enrolled late) in the course. Can I have an extension on A0? </b> <br>
    A: The assignment materials are available publicly online (above in the Schedule section) and if you are planning on enrolling in the class, we recommend working on it. As for submission, the last day we're accepting late submissions for A0 on Gradescope is 2/8. If you enrolled late, then please send an email to us (cos-484-2022@googlegroups.com) with proof of your enrollment date and we can provide late day waivers as needed. If there are other concerns about not being able to complete the assignment on time due to enrollment details or personal matters, send an email to cos-484-2022@googlegroups.com and we'll be happy to discuss your scenario in more detail.
